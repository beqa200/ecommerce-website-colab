# 🛒 Ecommerce Website – Algouni Competition

This project is an ecommerce website developed as part of a team competition at Algouni. I collaborated with one other front-end developer and a back-end developer (Python) to create a visually appealing and functional online store. The website allows users to add products to their basket and wishlist, providing a seamless shopping experience.
